        <h2>From Oranges to Apples</h2>
        <p>I vividly remember the freezing winter days of the late '80s in communist Romania. Me and my sister would join the long queue outside the grocery store, trying to get hold of one of the exotic looking fruits. Oranges. Offered one per person, they were nowhere enough for everyone. There was always hope that we might get a chance to taste it, but most of the times, their image and smell was all that we got. It was an incredible experience and it was worth it.</p>

        <p>30 years later, many things have changed. Romania has a democratic government, oranges and bananas are abundant and I moved to the UK to pursue an exciting career in technology. However, some things never change. Every now and then, I still find myself queueing in bad weather for many hours, surrounded by amazing people, all united by a single idea. The hope that this time we might be amongst the first to experience the latest Apple product.</p>

        <p>Most of time the iPhones would run out too before my turn would come. And that's ok. Because every now and then, I would get lucky. And when that happens, just as in the case of oranges, I get to experience something extraordinary, an experience greater than my imagination can conceive. My expectations are blown away ...</p>

        <p>These are the moments I live for. This is why I love technology.</p>
